# Next Steps

## Immediate / Unblocked
1. **Update listener cron-job.org from every 15 min to hourly** — agreed 2026-06-21; reduces GHA spend ~75%. Job ID: 7684877. Needs cron-job.org API key or manual update in the dashboard.
2. ~~**Fix analytics email reliability**~~ — done 2026-06-22; cron-job.org now triggers at 10:00 UTC (3am PT), email decoupled from push triggers.

## P&L
2. **Listing-level hierarchy refactor** — full design complete (see CLAUDE.md P&L section). Steps: (a) create `listing_groups` table in Supabase; (b) seed from `orders_raw` distinct listing_ids + titles; (c) add Listings tab to sheet for group assignment; (d) update `fetch_sales`, `fetch_ad_fees` to derive group from listing; (e) update P&L by Group formula to use listing-derived groups; (f) optionally add P&L by Listing tab. Decide whether to add P&L by Listing tab before starting.
3. **Fix stale tests** — `write_pl_tab` called with 3 args in tests but now takes 4 (`ad_fees_row_count`); `fetch_purchases` mock uses 6-column schema but now returns 7; Purchases batch preservation test index offsets wrong. Fix before next P&L deploy.
4. **Handle refunds** — refunded orders show as positive revenue in Sales tab. Fix: exclude/offset REFUND rows in `fetch_sales()` query.
5. **Manual entry UI** — New Entries tab functional but clunky. Approach (Flask/Streamlit/other) still TBD.

## Price Check (ready to build — plan fully designed)
5. **Build `listener/price_check.py`** — reads "Price Check" tab, calls Claude to simplify query, searches eBay Browse API, applies IQR + grade filter, writes Clearing/Holding prices back. Full plan at `/Users/eastcoastlimited/.claude/plans/fancy-skipping-teapot.md`.
6. **Add `search_listings_for_price()` to `listener/ebay.py`** — Browse API call, no price/time filters, returns `{price, title}` list, limit 200.
7. **Add sheet helpers to `listener/sheets.py`** — `read_price_check()` and `write_price_check_row()`.
8. **Create `.github/workflows/price-check.yml`** — `workflow_dispatch` only; needs `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`, `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LISTENER_SHEET_ID`, `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
9. **User setup** — create "Price Check" tab in Listener sheet with headers: Description | Hint URL | EPID | Clearing Price | Holding Price | # Listings | Last Checked.

## Traffic Analytics
10. **Fix orders vs quantity bug in daily email** — on 2026-06-23, 1 order for qty 3 was reported as 3 orders for qty 0. Orders and quantity are being counted/sourced incorrectly; needs investigation into how `compute_metrics` or `send_daily_report` aggregates these fields.
11. **Revenue metric in daily email** — `orders_raw.sale_price` is available; add a Revenue row to the report. (suggested)
12. **Weekly summary email** — Monday morning email aggregating the full prior week per listing. (suggested)

## Active Listings Counter (stub — details TBD)
13. **New listener subproject: count active listings for sealed products** — scan eBay for the number of active listings for specific sealed products the user tracks. User will provide more detail on scope and trigger. Parking here as a near-term project.
